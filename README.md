# animated-image-gallery
It's all about HTML5, some jQuesry were pasted / applied of [QuickSand plug-in](http://razorjack.net/quicksand/) but I am not good at jQuery at this moment. I will chenge it to AngularJS later. We are also using fancy-box plugin that let you use light boxes.

We have nice gallery and when we click on each category we'll see the images in that category, clicking on each image lead to pop up image with the capability of scrolling among images.
